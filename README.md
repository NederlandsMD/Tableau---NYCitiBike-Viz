# Tableau---NYCitiBike-Viz

This project includes three Tableau workbooks with various visualizations (storyboards, dashboards) to visaulize trends in the usage of the NY Citibike system in the months of January and June 2018. 

The workbooks are as follows:

1. NYCitiBike_Stations - Several dashboards on the popularity of each station, as a start and end station, in both January and June, includes several dynamic maps.

2. CitiBike Rider Demographics - a storyboard of various data relating to the ridership of NY CitiBikes, including popularity over time, gender, trip duration, and top stations each day.

3. Bike Report_NYCitiBikes - a dashboard on bike usage in June 2018, providing information about which bikes have been ridden the most, and thus likely due for replacement.

Also, a significant amount of data manipulation was accomplished using Python in Jupyter notebook, the file is:
